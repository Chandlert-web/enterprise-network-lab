# Enterprise Network Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design, configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting of a segmented enterprise network.  
The lab is built to mirror real-world enterprise and service provider environments, with an emphasis on reliability, scalability, and operational visibility.

---

## Objectives
- Design a structured enterprise network using VLAN segmentation
- Implement inter-VLAN routing and centralized network services
- Apply structured troubleshooting using the OSI model
- Demonstrate monitoring and operational best practices
- Document configurations and incident resolution clearly

---

## Network Architecture
The network is designed with multiple VLANs to separate traffic by function, improve security, and simplify troubleshooting.  
Routing is used to enable controlled communication between segments while maintaining isolation where required.

Planned components include:
- Access and distribution switching
- Inter-VLAN routing
- Centralized DHCP and DNS services
- Monitoring and alerting visibility

---

## Technologies & Tools
- **Routing & Switching:** Cisco IOS-style configuration
- **Networking:** TCP/IP, VLANs, Subnetting, ARP
- **Monitoring:** SNMP, ICMP, performance metrics
- **Troubleshooting:** OSI model, packet loss, latency analysis
- **Tools:** SolarWinds concepts, Wireshark, Linux, Git/GitHub
